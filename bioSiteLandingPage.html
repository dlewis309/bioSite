        <h2>Where it all started</h2>
        <p>Originally from Peoria Illinois, Asa lewis Jr. is truly the definition of a started from the bottom, rose to the 
top success story. After graduating from college, Asa knew immediately that his passion resided in youth 
development and coaching. He would go on to pursue a degree in education from which he will actually 
graduate this year. It wasn’t always sunshine and happy thoughts for Mr. Lewis though. Peoria Illinois is a 
dangerous and destructive city for most urban youth, and becoming the coach of many of these children, 
he was able to see this up close and personal. Without even trying, Asa was able to become more than 
just a coach to the children on his teams, he became a mentor and friend. His work with the children was 
applauded by the school and the community, leading him to begin work inside the school as well, 
providing guidance to troubled youth. This alone would be cause for celebration, but future tragedy 
would be the catalyst for his greatest accomplishment. On Feb 12th, 2017, his younger brother Marques 
was shot and killed while trying to prevent the shooting of a stranger at a valentine’s day party. While 
the grief was all but unbearable, Asa quickly saw this as a wakeup call to try and to lead change within 
his community. He went on to create a non-profit called Make Your Marq in honor of his brother. He has 
received rewards and accolades for his service.</p>
